# StudentIDCardScanner
The application's pipeline is as follows:
-Choose a photo of the card (The photo is acquired either using the mobile's built-in camera or simply chosen from gallery)
-Process this photo by applying several image processing techniques to "scan" it.
-Run a face detector classifier to detect the face on the card
-Run an OCR to detect the student's code on the card
-Inspect the card by searching for the recognized student code present on the card in the JSON file containing students information
